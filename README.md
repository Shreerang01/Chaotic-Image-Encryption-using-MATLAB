# chaotic-image-encryption
Information security has become a major issue during the last decades where new algorithms based on algebraic methods or chaotic dynamics were suggested for encryption. In this project, the encryption technique includes two main operations, permutation at pixel level and masking and permutation at bit level. Simulations show that the proposed encryption technique is effective and has a high-level security.

MATLAB was used for the implementation of Chaotic Digital Image Encryption. This encryption technique was tested for images of various sizes. But there is a drawback in this system that it works only with the images having equal number of pixels horizontally and vertically.
